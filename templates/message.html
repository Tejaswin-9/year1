        <h1>Dear Tvisha,</h1>
        <p>Where do I even begin? I can't believe how lucky I am to have found someone like you. You’ve brought so much joy into my life that it’s hard to put into words. Every day, you make my world brighter, and I’m so incredibly grateful for that.</p>

        <p>I still remember the first time I saw you at school. You were so stunning that I couldn’t even imagine you would ever notice someone like me. I thought you were way out of my league and to be honest, I still think that sometimes. But then came Vaibhavi’s birthday party. You walked in wearing that black dress, looking absolutely breathtaking. I couldn't take my eyes off you the whole night. It was like you had this magical aura around you, and I was completely captivated.</p>

        <p>I was too nervous to talk to you directly, so I asked Vaibhavi for help. When you sent me that first text, I was both excited and terrified. I didn’t know what to say or how to act at all it all felt like a dream. But we started talking, and before I knew it, I had called you the next night. We talked for two and a half hours, and I remember every moment of it. We talked again the next day for just as long. Those conversations meant everything to me, and they still do.</p>

        <p>When I decided to ask you out, I was probably the most nervous I’ve ever been in my life. You should have seen me I was looked soo fucked. My friends could tell how scared I was. But when I finally did it, the way I jumped with joy and ran to the bus afterward, it was one of the best moments of my life. From that moment on, everything changed.</p>

        <p>Since then, we’ve shared so many amazing memories, and every single one is special to me. I wouldn’t trade them for anything in the world. I hope we can stay together like this forever because I can’t imagine my life without you in it.</p>

        <p>You’re my everything, Tvisha. Thank you for being the incredible person you are, and thank you for letting me be a part of your life.</p>
